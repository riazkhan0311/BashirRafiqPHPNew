                    Islam does not allow the taking of life of a person simply because he is a non-Muslim or has gone back from Islam to disbelief. The golden rule of Islam is: "there is no compulsion in religion" (2:257).</p>

                <p>There was a time when Western influence in all spheres of life ruled the day. Asia, Africa, America and even islands like Japan and others in the Pacific, Atlantic and the Indian Oceans were under an all-pervading domain of the West. Great Britain prided itself on "Brittania rules the waves, ruleBrittania" and "never shall the sun set on the British Empire.</p>

                <p>In its July/September 1983 issue, the Muslim Digest of South
                    Africa has produced an article written by Al-Haj Hassan Raw at,
                    M.A; accusing therein the Promised Messiah, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam
                    Ahmad of Qadian of corrupting and interpolating some of the
                    verses of the Holy Quran. The article under comment says, "Even
                    the enemies of Islam have had to accept this fact that the Quranic
                    text is pure, free from corruption and interpolation since the days
                    of Prophet Muhammad, may peace of Allah be on him".</p>

                    The existence of a powerful political Jewish lobby in both Europe and America and the sway it exercises on the economic infrastructure (with tax concessions available to promote a tottering Israeli economy) creates an ideal formula for expansion to continue and for shuttlecock diplomacy to fail. The marriage with Christian-backed Lebanese eventually led to the invasion of their own homes and the reluctance to withdraw from occupied territory has taught them a bitter lesson.</p>

                    One objection that is raised against the Founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement isthat he was disrespectful towards Hazrat Isa (Jesus),peace be on him, and reviled him. In this connection it should be clearly understood that one of the claims of Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the Promised Messiah and Mahdi, peace be on him,was that he was the like ofHazrat Isa.</p>

                    The age in which we are living is also called theAge of reason. With the advancement in science and technology, we are to-day more and more convinced of the application of reason and logic in our dealings with life. Gone is the time when the masses could be compelledto accept a theory or dogma with blind faith. Mankind has laid great sacrifices for the achievement of this end.</p>

                <p>Hazrat Chaudhry Ghulam Muhammad Khan of Hoshiarpur (India) belonged to the distinguised and noble group of people who had the great privilege and honour to be amongst the earlier blessed companions of Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian the Promised Messiah and Holy Founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement. He joined the Movement in 1893 and had the distinction of performing his bait (initiation) at the hand of the Promised Messiah himself.</p>

                <p>The whole nation is paying the price of their arrogance, rebellion, disobedience and false pride, in rejecting the Promised Messiah as their savior. Their condition is now like a waterfall that goes down with full force and could not stop itself from falling into a deep pit. They have arrived now at a point of no return. Their destiny of destruction is written on the wall but they are totally blind and unable to read it. In the words of the Holy Quran they are deaf, dumb and blind.</p>
