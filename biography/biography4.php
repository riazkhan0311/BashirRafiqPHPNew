                <p>In 1962, Hadhrat Sahibzada Mirza Bashir Ahmad wrote to me and suggested that for the purpose of education, training and promoting mutual friendship amongst the members of the Jamaat it would be advisable to start a Paper on behalf of the British Mission. He said that it did not really matter if the paper consisted only of a few pages.</p>

                <p>Immediately opposite the Queen's Palace in Central London, full of colorful flowers and some very tall trees, is situated a very attractive and extensive Park. On one side of the Park, there is a whole string of famous Hotels and on the other; there are shops on the Oxford Street. Right in the middle of the Park there is a beautiful lake called 'The Serpentine', which is spread over an area of 41 acres. In the summer, </p>

                <p>At Hyde Park Corner, amongst the regular speakers was a Mr John Webster, who had, for 30 years been speaking on various subjects. In 1960, it was he who attracted the largest crowds. A while ago, a book entitled 'Speakers of the Hyde Park' was published and in it, a prominent mention of Mr Webster was made. His story covered many pages of the book. Soon after my arrival in England, I started going to Hyde Park regularly. </p>

                <p>In America, at the turn of the century, some business persons, friendly with each other, got together in a restaurant for their midday meal. In their casual conversation, it was mentioned that mostly the business persons remained so engrossed in the promotion of their trade or industry that they had no time left either for social contacts, or for acquiring intimate knowledge regarding subjects other than their own trade or industry. </p>

For their inaugural flight, they invited some Pakistani and British dignitaries from London to fly with them in the new Boeing. I also received an invitation. Perhaps in the month of April 1960, with permission from the Centre, I went to Pakistan for nearly a month. During my stay there, two or three times, I had the good fortune of an audience with Huzoor who, </p>
