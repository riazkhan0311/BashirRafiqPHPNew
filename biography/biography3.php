                <p>In 1945, when I was in my eighth class, I devoted most of my time to studies. I was not inclined towards outdoor games. Once, a friend suggested that we should go out into the open fields and enjoy the open-air surroundings. I agreed and after school, we both went out of the township into an open environment where the crops in the fields, green trees and flowers flourished and we enjoyed them all. Suddenly, my friend took a packet of cigarettes out of his pocket. </p>

                <p>After having graduated as a 'Shahid' from Jamia, I presented myself at the office of Wakalat e Tabsheer. Hadhrat Sahibzada Mirza Mubarak Ahmad was the then Wakeel ut Tabsheer. Both the late Basharat Ahmad Bashir and Hasan Muhammad Khan Arif were his deputies. The Wakalat, as was normal, sought directions from Hadhrat Khalifa tul Masih II about my posting. Huzoor directed that I be sent to England. Preparations for the journey began to be made.</p>

                <p>On 18th February 1959, we left Liverpool, where our ship had docked and reached London Euston Station. At the station we were received by Imam of the London Mosque Maulood Ahmad Khan, Abdul Azeez Deen, Chaudhry Muhammad Ashraf, Moulvi Abd ur Rahman and Professor Sultan Mahmood Shahid. We proceeded towards the Mission House in Moulvi Abd ur Rahman's car.</p>

                <p>Suddenly in 1970, I began to feel very thirsty and my tongue seemed as dry as a twig. In order to relieve my bladder during the night I had to get up several times. Once, I mentioned this problem to Hadhrat Chaudhry Zafrulla Khan and he asked me to see a doctor at once. My doctor sent me to a Hospital for tests of blood etc. Some tests were carried out after intake of glucose. I was asked to return in a few days. When I met the specialist, he told me that I had become a diabetic. I felt that a sentence of death had been pronounced on me and for a few moments, I was completely stunned. The Doctor asked me not to worry and said that, with proper care and daily exercise, this problem can be brought under control. He gave me detailed instructions.</p>

                <p>In 1960, while in England, I made up my mind to launch a monthly periodical. The then Imam of the London Mosque, Maulood Ahmad Khan warned me that it was not going to be an easy undertaking. He told me that I must not expect much help from the Mission. After a lot of prayers and in consultation with some friends, I applied for permission from the Centre. At my first attempt, the Centre turned me down. They said:</p>
