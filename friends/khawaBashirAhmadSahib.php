                    <p>Khwaja Sahib had arrived in Britain in the early sixties. He was a professional teacher. Khwaja Sahib had a charming personality and was always well dressed. He had a vast knowledge of Islam and Ahmadiyyat. He was extremely hospitable, courteous and polite. In the early sixties when the first Ahmadiyya Sunday School was established, Khwaja Bashir Ahmad took charge as its first Headmaster. A.R. Chaudhry, Daud Ahmad Gulzar and Moulvi Abd ur Rahman assisted him. Later on Malik Abd ul Azeez also joined the teaching staff.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>Khwaja sahib was a sincere, loyal and trustworthy close friend of mine. He was like a brother to me.
