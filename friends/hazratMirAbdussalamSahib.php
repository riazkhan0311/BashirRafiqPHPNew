                    <p>Hazrat Mir Abdussalam Sahib was a Companion of the Promised Messiah. Before his arrival in Britain he was the Amir of Sialkot Jamaat. He was a Cricketer and a Sportsman. </p>
                    <br />

                    <p>Hazrat Mir was a handsome person and was always well dressed. He had full command over English language and was a great Orator and Debater. His knowledge of Bible and the Holy Quran was vast. On my arrival he warmly welcomed me and offered to assist me in my missionary work. I was greatly impressed by his vast knowledge, piety and righteousness.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>Hazrat Mir Sahib was a regular speaker on Islam at Hyde Park Corner, on Sundays. He invited me to attend his oratory sessions and help him in carrying his make shift rostrum. This was a most informative and educative experience for me and I enjoyed these sessions. After his speech there used to be a lively Question Answer session. Hazrat Mir Sahib encouraged me to take part in it and to answer some questions. I was not fluent in English then and was reluctant to answer questions but Hazrat Mir Sahib insisted that I should take part in it. Slowly I gained confidence and was able to take part in the discussion.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>After his oratory sessions we would go to a caf√© in Marble Arch and would also invite some Non Muslims for further discussions on various Islamic aspects. Hazrat Mir Sahib believed in the freedom of speech and expression and would patiently listen to those who raised objections against Islam. He never lost his temper and was most considerate.To begin with, we talked about Hadhrat Qazi Sahib and my father. Maulana Muhammad Tufail, at that time Imam of the Berlin Mosque and who, later on, for a long time, served as Imam of the Woking Mosque, joined us for a sumptuous meal. The conversation that ensued was both interesting and enlightening. Maulana Tufail said: </p>

                    <div class="quote">"For no reason at all you believe that Mirza Mahmud Ahmad is the Musleh Maood. The Musleh Maood will appear a lot later. Have you any proof that Mirza Mahmud Ahmad is the Musleh Maood?"</div>

                    <p> I said:</p>

                    <div class="quote"> "Surely you believe the Hadeeth in which the Holy Prophet (pbuh)said that Satan cannot assume his appearance and surely you will also agree that the Satan cannot assume the resemblance of the Promised Messiah (pbuh)"</div>

                    <p> Maulana Tufail said that he accepted this tradition to be true. Then I said:</p>

                    <div class="quote"> "I swear by the Almighty that I have seen a very clear and transparent dream in which the Promised Messiah confirmed that Mirza Mahmud Ahmad was the Musleh Maood."</div>

                    <p>I related my dream as follows:</p>

                    <div class="quote"> "In a dream I saw a raised platform in the middle of a vast ground in which there were a large number of people assembled. A few were seated on the raised platform and I was one of them. Right in the middle of the raised platform sat Hadhrat Mirza Mahmud Ahmad on a chair. There was complete silence in which one could hear a pin drop. It was announced that the Promised Messiah (pbuh) is on his way. I saw the Promised Messiah taking slow steps towards the platform. He had a staff in his hand and was wearing a long robe. In a short while, he got to the chair on which Hadhrat Mirza Mahmud was seated. Huzur placed his hand on the shoulder of Hadhrat Mirza Mahmud Ahmad and said; 'Some people are spreading misinformation concerning this son of mine. Today I wish to make it quite clear as to what his status is in the spiritual world.' Then in a loud voice, the Promised Messiah repeated the words of the prophecy concerning the Musleh Mauood. After mentioning each attribute, pointing towards his son, he said that this attribute had been granted to him. In this manner he read the whole of the prophecy and again and again confirmed that it pertained to Hadhrat Mirza Mahmud Ahmad. In the end, in a most inspiring manner the Promised Messiah said; 'Remember that Mahmud is a solid rock, whoever collides with him will be out of order into smithereens and with whosoever he collides with will be broken into smithereens'. After this the Promised messiah departed." </div>

                    <p>I asked Maulana Tufail what he had to say in this regard. He said that since I had seen the dream it might be a proof to me.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>Maulana Muhammad Yaqoob listened to our conversation in complete silence. After lunch I offered two Nawafil in the Shah Jehan Mosque and then took leave of the Maulana. I asked him if he was going to reply to the letter from Qazi Sahib. The Maulana said that he would send a reply to Qazi Sahib's letter by post. A few days later, I received an open letter from Maulana Yaqoob Khan, addressed to Qazi sahib written in Pushto, which I read. In his letter, he said that every word contained in Qazi Sahib's letter was true. He tried to justify and explain his position by saying that the boat in which he was sailing had covered a great distance. However, he did ask for prayers. I posted the letter to Qazi Sahib.
                        Later on I met the Maulana on many occasions and during every meeting, I found him absolutely full of praise for the Musleh Maood. I was indeed surprised that although he belonged to the 'Ehl e Paigham', in his own heart he had such great esteem for the Musleh Maood.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>A short while later, before his return to Pakistan, the Maulana came to the London Fazl Mosque to see me and my wife Salima Begum. He said that he had made up his mind to spend a whole day with us. I thoroughly enjoyed his interesting and instructive discourse.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>Shortly after his return to Pakistan he wrote to Hadhrat Khalifa tul Masih III saying that he wanted to swear allegiance at his hand. To enable him to fill in the necessary form for joining the fold Huzoor directed Hadhrat Maulana Abul Ata to meet Maulana Muhammad Yaqoob. After signing on the dotted line the Maulana asked Maulana Abul Ata to particularly advise me in London as I also had contributed in his joining the fold. Maulana Abul Ata wrote to me and congratulated me.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>In the same year during the Jalsa Salaana at Rabwah Hadhrat Maulana Muhammad Yaqoob summoned me and met me with great warmth. He offered very many prayers for me and then he made enquiries concerning the Mosque in Woking. I told him that the Mosque was no longer in the custody of 'Ehl e Paigham' but was in the control of non Ahmadi Muslims. He said:</p>

                    <div class="quote"> "That is good; in that Mosque a Baiat in the name of the Promised Messiah could not be managed, how could such a Mosque then be linked with Ahmadiyyat?"</div>
