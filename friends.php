                <p>I arrived on 19th February, 1959 and took charge as Deputy Imam of The London Mosque. The next day a gentleman called Maulvi Abdur Rehman introduced himself to me. He told me that he was sent in early forties by Hazrat Khalifatul Masih II as a trade missionary to Britain. He worked in that position for sometime and then he got retirement and settled in London. He was the owner of a Pakistani Restaurant and was also a member of the Finance Committee of the U.K Mission.</p>
