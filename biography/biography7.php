                <p>In accordance with the instructions from Hadhrat Khalifa tul Masih III, when I was preparing myself to participate in the Annual Convention in Rabwah in December 1977, it occurred to me that since, in the following year an International Conference on 'Deliverance of Jesus from the Cross' was to be held, why not persuade a British Press representative to accompany me to Rabwah. (Further details appear elsewhere). He could, after attending the Conference, </p>

                <p>Dr. Batalvi was not really a religious person and he claimed that he was secular. He bitterly opposed the activities of the Mullahs in Pakistan. Once, while talking to Hadhrat Chaudhry Muhammad Zafrulla Khan on the subject of the life and character of the Holy Prophet (saw), Chaudhry Sahib related certain heartrending incidents in Huzoor's life concerning his attributes of forgiveness and of overlooking the faults of others. During the conversation </p>

                <p>Abdul Qayyum Khan played a very important role in the history of Pakistan. Before partition, he was Deputy Leader of the All India Congress Party. On the formation of Pakistan, he became Chief Minister of the Frontier Province. For many years, he ruled the Frontier Province with an iron hand and great awe. He introduced some revolutionary reforms and firmly established the province on the road to progress. Then he took charge of the Commerce and </p>

Hadhrat Khalifa tul Masih IV himself travelled to Qadian to participate in that blessed occasion. I was privileged to accompany Huzoor as Huzoor had very kindly included me in his entourage. We flew to Delhi on the appointed date and after a few days' stay there, via Amritsar and Batala, travelled by train to Qadian. After partition of the sub-continent, this was the first </p>
