                    <p>Another person, Muhammad Akram Khan Ghauri also migrated from East Africa. He settled in a house that he bought near the mosque and remained engaged in service to the Jamaat. He would visit the Mission House every morning and would help me in my work voluntarily. He was a saintly person and was very humble and righteous. One of his great qualities was his hospitality. On one of his visits to London Hazrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad Sahib stayed with him and enjoyed his hospitality. He was devout followers of Hazrat Masih Mauood and had read most of his books. He also translated one of his books into English. May Allah grant him an elevated station in Heaven.</p>
