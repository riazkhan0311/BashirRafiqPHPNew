                        <p>Accepting this advice, the British Government ordered that the Maharaja should be taken off the ship and returned to England on another ship. That was exactly what happened and that was exactly in accordance with the information from the Almighty. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Before leaving Rabwah, I had advised Mr. Abdullah Shabooti, the father of my dear friend Mahmood Shabooti that I would be passing through Aden. Mr Abdullah who lived in Aden was a dedicated and devoted Ahmadi. After having accepted Ahmadiyyat, he had to face innumerable problems but he never wavered.</p>
                        <br>
                        <img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="../img/biography/myEarlyLifeInEngland/untitled5.jpg" alt="">
                        <br>
                        <p>As soon as our ship had anchored, Mr Abdullah, along with a Somalian servant, came on to the deck. He welcomed me with warmth and deep affection. To look around Aden and meet other members of the Jamaat, he asked me to spend the whole day with him. He invited me to attend a Reception being arranged by members of the Aden Ahmadiyya Jamaat. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p> By a motorboat, along with him, accompanied by my wife and Munir Ahmad we landed at the harbor. From there, in his motorcar, we went to call at Dr. Muhammad Ahmad’s surgery in Aden. The Doctor was of Indian descent and was indeed a devoted and a committed Ahmadi. Two of his sons were my class fellows in Qadian. We stayed with him until lunchtime and met many friends and exchanged views. After Zohr, along with some members of the Jamaat, we set out sightseeing. Aden had assumed a modern pattern. Tall and stylish buildings had been built on an attractive dual carriageway. It presented a pleasing picture. In the evening, we returned to the ship.  </p>

                        <br>
                        <img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="../img/biography/myEarlyLifeInEngland/untitled6.jpg" alt="">
                        <br>
                        <p>Mr Abdullah’s love and devotion, his dedicated approach to the Jamaat and his firm commitment to Khilafat, left an indelible mark on me. Mr. Abdullah was probably the first Ahmadi in Aden. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The ship proceeded towards its next destination. Once again we were encircled by water. Very early on 31st January, when it was still dark, we entered the Suez Canal. Right alongside is situated the township of Suez. On either side of the canal, there were small villages and the local population was seemed engaged in agriculture. Most passengers came out on deck, as the landscape on either side of the canal was eye-catching. At 11 o’clock, the ship entered the Great Bitter Lake in which, at that time, fifteen to twenty ships were already anchored. There are three or four of such spacious lakes along the canal. To ensure smooth flow of traffic some vessels from either side are asked to wait there. Thus, there is no problem in navigation and the traffic flows unhindered. Our ship remained on anchor until 5 p.m. </p>
                        <br>
                        <img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="../img/biography/myEarlyLifeInEngland/untitled7.jpg" alt="">
                        <br>
                        <p>In the canal, ships may not exceed the speed of five miles per hour. While in the canal the ships remain under the control of Egyptian pilots. At that time, to pass through the canal, every large vessel had to pay £3,000 as canal fees. The Suez Canal is 118 feet wide and 30 feet deep. It stretches over a distance of 101 miles. At one end of the canal is Suez and at the other Port Saeed. It joins the Red Sea with the Mediterranean.  </p>
                        <br>
                        <img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="../img/biography/myEarlyLifeInEngland/untitled8.jpg" alt="">
                        <br>
                        <p>We reached Port Saeed at 1 a.m. and anchored there for the night. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>It was announced in the morning that those who wished to look around the town could leave the ship after breakfast. They were warned to exercise great care against pickpockets and cheats. This announcement came as a shock to me as we were to land in a Muslim country where the reputation of the locals was so appalling. We hired a taxi that took us around the town in exchange of 10 shillings. A wealthy person named Abd ur Rahman had built a most beautiful Mosque in Port Saeed. To decorate the Mosque, beautiful Turkish carpets and Venetian chandeliers had been provided. </p>

                        <br>
                       <img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="../img/biography/myEarlyLifeInEngland/untitled9.jpg" alt="">
                        <br>

                        <p>In the dealings in the streets of Port Saeed, there was no trace of decency or honesty. It is indeed regrettable and a shame that tourists were often asked ten times the acceptable price. </p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Death on the ship

                        </h2>
                        <p>An old lady from Bombay who was sailing on SS Caledonia died of Heart attack between Port Saeed and Gibraltar.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>We were very sad to learn of the sad demise of the lady. Her son and daughter in law were badly grief stricken. Late in the afternoon it was announced that the lady would be buried at sea according to the maritime laws. All the passengers gathered on the deck. The body of the lady was lying on a stretcher on the edge of the deck. In complete silence a vicar recited some prayers and sprinkled some holy water on the body. </p>

                        <img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="../img/biography/myEarlyLifeInEngland/untitled10.jpg" alt="">
                        <br>

                        <p>The Captain of the ship then signaled to bury the body and Stewarts promptly dropped the body in the sea. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>At 4.30 in the afternoon on February 3rd, the ship started sailing towards Gibraltar. During that part of the voyage, instructions were received from the British Government that a few British soldiers had to be picked up from Cyprus. Therefore, the ship had to make a detour and the next day we arrived at Limassol, a Cypriot port.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>Offering all kinds of alcoholic drinks at ridiculously low prices a number of small boats came alongside. The European passengers showed great interest and a large number of bottles were purchased. On enquiry, I was told that there were a number of breweries that were able to sell their products at highly discounted prices. So much so that some exchanged a bottle of wine for a packet of cigarettes.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>We were not allowed to go ashore at Limassol but we were able to view the beautiful township from the deck. Hills covered with greenery presented an attractive panorama.</p>
