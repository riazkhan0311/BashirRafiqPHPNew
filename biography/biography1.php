                    <p> My life has not been of a whole string of beads of success and progress or an album of discharge of significant responsibilities. I am fully aware of my weaknesses, my lapses and my sins. I am also fully aware that whatever I have been blessed with has arisen directly from the prayers of my parents, my elders, particularly Hadhrat Chaudhry Muhammad Zafrullah Khan and the Caliphs of Ahmadiyyat. I did not really have a hand in any success that has come my way.</p>

                    <p>I recall watching peasants of the village, after a day's hard toil, singing songs in their melodious voices, driving flocks of their animal home, as treasures of my earliest recollections. They would be singing aloud. My village Mohib Banda is situated right in the midst of the agricultural fields. A few miles from my village, impatiently, in turbulent rapid waves, the water of the river Kabul joins the river Sindh at Attok. At sunset, every day, standing on the bank of the river, I would survey the beautiful panorama. On occasion, during moonlit nights, humming a tune, I would watch the reflection of the moon in the waves. </p>

                    <p> In 1976, as his Private Secretary, I accompanied Hadhrat Khalifa tul Masih III on his tour of North America. While in Toronto, we were staying at the 'Inn on the Park Hotel', my wife called me from London. Her voice was choked with emotion. She said that she did not know how to convey the terrible news to me while I was on a journey. I insisted and she told me that my father had passed away. I felt as if lightning had fallen straight over my head. I blanked out and the telephone fell from my hand. Naturally, I started crying bitterly. </p>

                    <p> In order to enable people to accept His truth, when the Almighty commissions a Messenger, he employs a variety of means. He opens their hearts for the acceptance of truth. On hearing the message, they believe promptly. He show dreams to some and thus directs their attention to the Truth and enables them to believe.</p>

                    <p> In December 1944, my father made up his mind to participate in the Annual Jalsa at Qadian. My brother Nazir Ahmad and I accompanied him. From Peshawar, we travelled by train in a railway compartment reserved for Ahmadis. As soon as the train began to move, we offered a long collective prayer. This was my first experience of joining in a collective prayer. All of us were sobbing and wailing and I was deeply affected. </p>
