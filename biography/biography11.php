                <p>In 1974 Mr Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto held the reigns of power in his hand. A few years earlier, the Jamaat Ahmadiyya had helped his 'People's Party' in the General Election as it was laid down in their Manifesto and Constitution that religion or faith is a personal matter for every individual and the government had no right to interfere. All other political parties were bitterly opposed to Ahmadiyyat and were not prepared to tolerate </p>

                <p>When I first arrived in England, the Jamaat mainly consisted of young married couples and therefore there was no problem about Tarbiyyat of their children. However, in 1962 very many from Pakistan, India and East Africa migrated to England. Obviously, they came with their children. There was therefore an obvious need to organize programs for the Tarbiyyat of the children and the young on a sound basis so that our new generation may not become a victim of the western </p>

                <p>Throughout his life, like a moon, Dr Saeed Ahmad Khan kept on illuminating his surroundings. He was indeed endowed with some rare and superlative attributes. He was gifted with superb principles to which he strictly adhered all his life. Fear of God and sympathy for others, were firmly ingrained in his character. He was an arch lover of Hadhrat Muhammad Mustafa SAW and of the Promised Messiah. He was passionate about calling others to the path of Allah. He was very hospitable, extremely well mannered and a true devotee to the institution of Khilafat.</p>
