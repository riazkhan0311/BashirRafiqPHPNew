                <p>Even when I was a student, I had heard the name of Mr Montgomery Watt and I had been impressed by the fact that he had written a number of books on Islam. Although I did not get an opportunity to read his books when I was at college, on arrival in England, however, I had the urge to read his books, particularly 'Muhammad at Mecca' and 'Muhammad at Medina'. I was also keen to meet him. He was then Professor of Islamic Studies at the Edinburgh University. </p>

                <p>In April 1964, I was appointed Imam of the Fazl Mosque in London. Shortly after assuming charge I felt that for the education and training of the Jamaat in England it was essential to hold Annual Conventions (Jalsas) so that at least once a year all Ahmadis in England and some from the Continent could get together. I called a meeting of the Executive Committee to chalk out a program for the holding of the First Annual Jalsa.</p>

                <p>In 1965 in the course of Hadhrat Chaudhry Muhammad Zafrulla Khan's visit to London, in an inspiring manner, he made a mention of the names and their sincerity to the Faith of several European converts. He expressed a desire to hold a convention of such European Ahmadis so that they may be provided an opportunity to interact with each other. Ways and means, he said, of their further education and training could be discussed in this convention. </p>

                <p>In June 1967 Mubarak Ahmad Saqi, who was then Ameer and Missionary in Charge in Liberia wrote to me to tell me that in the immediate future the Liberian President was visiting England. He recommended that, on his arrival, the British Ahmadiyya Jamaat should welcome him. He said that the President's relationship with the Jamaat in Liberia was both warm and cordial.</p>
