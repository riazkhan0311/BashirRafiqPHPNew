                    <p>Suddenly in 1970, I began to feel very thirsty and my tongue seemed as dry as a twig. In order to relieve my bladder during the night I had to get up several times. Once, I mentioned this problem to Hadhrat Chaudhry Zafrulla Khan and he asked me to see a doctor at once. My doctor sent me to a Hospital for tests of blood etc. Some tests were carried out after intake of glucose. I was asked to return in a few days. When I met the specialist, he told me that I had become a diabetic. I felt that a sentence of death had been pronounced on me and for a few moments, I was completely stunned. The Doctor asked me not to worry and said that, with proper care and daily exercise, this problem can be brought under control. He gave me detailed instructions.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>When I got back home, I found Hadhrat Chaudhry Sahib waiting for me. I told him that I had some good news and some bad news and asked him which one he wanted to hear first. The good news, I said, was that we were now associates. And the bad news, I said, was that I had become a Diabetic. Hadhrat Chaudhry Sahib asked me not to be too concerned as he had been a Diabetic for forty years.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>He said:</p>

                    <div class="quote">
                        "Diabetes is like a stubborn horse. If a rider takes necessary care and remains on his guard, he can really enjoy riding a stubborn horse. However, if a rider is not attentive the horse will rebel and throw him on the ground. If Diabetes remains under control, one's daily life can continue normally. Otherwise, very hazardous results can ensue. Because of this sickness, the amount of sugar in the blood increases and that can be damaging. As the blood circulates throughout the body, other organs can be affected. When sugar in the blood exceeds the normal level, different organs can be affected. Because of Diabetes one can see so many suffering from loss of sight, loss of teeth and a weak heart. To control Diabetes it is necessary to take three very important precautions. First: regular medical checks and strictly following medical advice. Second: daily exercise, for example, a brisk walk for two or two and a half miles. Third: due care in the intake of food and a total ban on those items of food prohibited by the Doctor. On a regular basis, I consult Dr. Jocelyn who is one of the topmost specialists in Diabetes. Then, I faithfully follow his advice."</div>

                    <p>Once when I visited him, after a thorough examination, he told me that all was well. Then he said that as far as possible I should exercise care in some other matters such as, the excessive use of coffee. I told him that I drink eleven mugs of coffee every day and I had, to a degree, become addicted to coffee. However, from that moment, I said, I would give up drinking coffee altogether. The Doctor said that this sudden move may not be possible and that I should reduce the intake gradually. When I came down the stairs I made up my mind not to touch coffee and in the last fifteen or twenty years I have not taken a drop of coffee.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>After he had finished giving me detailed instructions, I expressed my doubt if I would be able to exercise such restraint. At that point, Chaudhry Sahib related an interesting story.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>He said:</p>

                    <div class="quote">
                        "When I was Foreign Minister of Pakistan I suddenly received a call from the Prime Minister's house telling me that the Prime Minister, Khwaja Nazim ud Deen, needed my presence immediately. When I called, the Prime Minister was in his study. He asked me to sit down and said; 'After examination, the doctors have discovered that I have become a diabetic. I thought it best to seek your advice, as you have been able to bring your diabetes under control. So please advise me.' In about three quarters of an hour, in great detail I told him how to conduct his life and how to be careful in his diet. I even told him what to eat and what not to eat. For a while, Khwaja Sahib kept completely silent.</div>

                    <p>Then he said;</p>

                    <div class="quote">
                        "I have listened to your advice with great care and attention and I have noted how I should conduct my life. However, I regret that I will not be able to. It is impossible for me to bring about such a big change in my eating habits'."</div>

                    <p>Looking at me Chaudhry Sahib said:</p>

                    <div class="quote">
                        "I hope you will not say what the Khwaja Sahib said i.e. 'I have carefully listened to your advice with great attention but I regret I will not be able to act in accordance with it'."</div>

                    <p>Then Chaudhry Sahib referred to the commands in the Holy Quran about use of only Halal (legitimate and chaste) and Tayyab items of food. He said:</p>
                    <br />

                    <div class="quote">"We all know what 'Halal' means but what is meant by Tayyab? Use of sugar, for example is Halal but for Diabetics it is not Tayyab. The Holy Quran, which is a book of great perception and wisdom, has made clear that Halal items may be consumed by everyone, but since some items of food are not Tayyab for some they should refrain from their use. Those Diabetics who order their lives in accordance with medical advice normally live long lives as their diet becomes balanced."</div>

                    <p>Since Chaudhry Sahib lived to be 93 years old, perhaps the secret of his long life was that he was most careful in what he ate. In any case, overeating is injurious to health and obesity is a disease in itself.
                        An early morning brisk walk is most helpful for Diabetics. A two-mile brisk walk can produce great beneficial results. The following homeopathic medicines brought me some relief;</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>Natrum Sulph 200 once a week, Natrum Sulph 30 twice a day. Along with these, use of Five Phoses is also helpful</p>
