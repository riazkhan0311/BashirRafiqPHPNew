                        <p>The Captain was sitting at a separate table in the company of some friends. I sat next to him and we talked as follows:  </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Captain:</p>
                        <div class="quote">"You’ve declined to bring your wife into the Dining Room as she observed Purdah and cannot intermix with other males. As you are going to Europe, how will you cope there?" I said, “Sir, I am going to Europe as a missionary of Islam, to make clear to the local population that our ladies hold highly respectable and elevated position according to the teachings of Islam. Purdah is designed to protect the honor and chastity of women. How can I turn away from an objective, which is contrary to my mission in Europe?" </div>
                        <p>Captain:</p>
                        <div class="quote">"In my view, imprisoning ladies in Purdah is tantamount to being narrow minded. If women were given free choice not one of them would volunteer to remain in this jail.” I said, "Sir, my wife is an educated woman. She is intelligent and she has quite happily and of her own will, decided to remain in Purdah. There is no pressure on her from my side. I can prove it by asking you to talk to her yourself. Having full regard to the fact that she observes Purdah you can meet her." Captain: "If you insist. Would it not be proper that without any third person you two can sit on a separate table in the Dining Room?"</div>
                        <p> I said, “This will be a most appropriate arrangement and I will be grateful to you." The Captain issued orders and we had the advantage of sitting at a table by ourselves.  </p>

                        <br>
                        <h2>Arrival at Aden (Yemen).
                            <br>
                            <small>1960</small>
                        </h2>

                        <p>At 8 o clock on the morning of 27th January the shore became visible. Almost all the passengers assembled on the deck. The sight of land appeared most attractive as we saw the land for the first time in four days. Around eleven o clock the ship dropped anchor outside the Aden harbor. In Aden, the ships always anchored away from the shore and motorboats were used to take passengers ashore. The Captain announced that to look around passengers could go ashore but must return before 7.00 p.m. as the ship would then sail. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The Jamaat has an outstanding historic bond with Aden. Once when Maharajah Daleep Singh was returning to India from his exile in England, it was from Aden that he was ordered to return to England. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>When the British defeated the Sikh Government, they took the young prince Daleep Singh to England so that the commotion amongst Sikhs may subside. Maharajah Daleep Singh arrived in London when he was very young. He was housed in Guildford and then he moved to London. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>A beautiful Hotel named Cannizaro is situated in Wimbledon. Before the building became a Hotel, it belonged to Maharajah Daleep Singh and he stayed in it for some time.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Daleep Singh had a very cordial relationship with Queen Victoria and he was often invited into the Royal Palace. Once, while they were drinking tea on a balcony in the Buckingham Palace, Daleep Singh expressed a desire to have a glimpse of the Kohinoor diamond. The Queen went into her room and brought the Kohinoor. The Maharajah put it on the palm of his hand. To look at it in a better light he walked to the end of the balcony. The Queen dreaded that the Maharajah might throw the diamond away. Daleep Singh, who was a very intelligent person, guessed the Queen’s suspicion and said to her:</p>
                        <div class="quote">“Madam! The rightful owner of the diamond would like to present it to your Majesty”. </div>
                        <br>
                        <p>The Queen repossessed the diamond and appreciated Daleep Singh’s sense of humor.</p>
                        <br>

                        <br>

                        <p>Daleep Singh had an intense desire to visit the Punjab, stay there for a while and meet his near and dear ones. On a number of occasions, he had sought permission from the British Government and finally permission was granted. However, as soon as the Maharajah boarded a ship, the Indian newspapers published the news and with great anticipation, many started waiting impatiently for the Maharajah to land on the Indian soil. .</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>There was great eagerness, particularly amongst the Sikhs. To welcome him they made programs to hold elaborate functions. In anticipation, there was merrymaking all around. The Maharajah was seeing visions of an astounding reception and a bright future. </p>

                        <p>At that point in time, on hearing from the Almighty, the Promised Messiah predicted that the Maharaja would not be able to return to India. Not only did the Promised Messiah tell his friends of this communication from the Almighty, but he also made a mention of it in a Handbill. On the one hand, there was definite news from the Almighty and on the other; the ship carrying the Maharaja was happily proceeding towards India. The Promised Messiah, Alaihisalam, wrote in his book, Nuzul Masih, the following,</p>
                        <br>
                        <div class="quote">“When it was widely rumored that Daleep Singh was arriving in the Punjab, I was shown [in a vision] that Daleep Singh would fail in his intention, and would never set foot in India. I told this vision to Lala Sharampat, an Arya who lived in Qadian, as well as to several other Hindus and Muslims. I also published an announcement that was printed and distributed in February 1882. And this is exactly what happened. Daleep Singh had to turn back from Aden, and his honour and comfort were seriously jeopardized, exactly as I had already told hundreds of people.”</div><strong>[Nuzul-ul-Masih, Ruhani Khaza’in, vol. 18, p. 604]</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>In the meantime, the British Government was advised by the Indian Secret Service Agency that the Maharaja should be prevented from returning to India. It was feared that if he returned to the Punjab the movement to hold his Coronation would be revived and strengthened and then the British Government might have to face problems. By then the ship had actually reached Aden.</p>
