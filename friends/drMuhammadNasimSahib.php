                    <p>Dr Nasim Sahib was a retired Judge of the Allahabad High Court. On his retirement he migrated to London and settled in Central London. On my arrival in London in February, 1959 he was the General Secretary of the UK Jamaat. Soon after my arrival I was appointment General Secretary and Naib Imam. I took charge from Dr. Nasim Sahib.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>Dr. Nasim Sahib was a scholar, a prolific writer and an orator. He wrote articles for various magazines and delivered scholarly lectures at the general meetings of the Jamaat.
                        Hospitality was a great quality of Dr. Sahib. He used to invite members of the High Commission of Pakistan and other dignitories to dinners at his residence. I had the privilege of being invited by him on all such occasions. His circle of friendship was vast.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>He was a friend of the Monarch of Malaysia. The King visited London in 1960 and was staying at the Claridges Hotel. Dr. Sahib used to meet him at the Hotel. He invited me also to meet the King and to give him some literature of the Ahmadiyya Movement. The king received us with open arms and offered us coffee. I had an opportunity to convey to him the message of Ahmadyyat and presented him some books about Ahmadiyyat.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>Dr. Sahib had a charming personality. One of his great qualities was his punctuality. He was a well dressed person.
                        His wife was the first President of Lajna Imaullah UK.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Bilal Nuttle
                        I was Imam of the London Mosque when Hadhrat Khalifa tul Masih II passed away in 1965. Thousands of miles away from the Centre, all Ahmadis in Britain, active in their prayers, were impatiently waiting to hear who had been elected to be the third Khalifa. Engrossed in these thoughts many Ahmadis had assembled in the Mission House. A British Ahmadi Muslim, Bilal Nuttall, approached me and told me that he knew who the next Khalifa would be. I was very surprised and asked him how he knew ahead of the election who would be chosen to be the new Khalifa. Bilal Nuttall gave me a photograph that he had in his hand and in a choking voice said: "Here is a photograph of Sahibzada Nasir Ahmad, taken in the London Mosque that he gave me. In those days, he was up at Oxford for his studies. I was very close to him and I found him to be God fearing, well mannered and an arch lover of the Holy Prophet (PBUH). After my first glimpse at the Sahibzada I had always been absolutely certain that he deserved to occupy the exalted position of Khilafat and that the Jamaat would surely elect him, when the time came." Bilal Nuttall was still with me when we received a telegram from the Centre telling us that Hadhrat Mirza Nasir Ahmad had been elected as the third Khalifa. Being far sighted, in Huzoor's youth, for the fulfilment of a monumental task, Bilal had his eye on him. He was a witness that Huzoor was a chaste, pious and God-fearing person. He was also a witness that Huzoor was an arch lover of the Holy Prophet of Islam.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>Bilal used to spend his weekends at the Mission House. During this time he would mow the garden of the Mission House, clean the Mission House and even would cook delicious Indian curries. Bilal remained a bachelor all his life.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>He had the honour and privilege to call the first Adhan ( Call for prayers) representing the English Ahmadi Muslim Community on the official opening of the Mosque. Hazrat Malik Ghulam Farid Sahib gave the first Adhan representing the AsianAhmadi Muslim Community.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>We organised a meeting at the Mission House to commemorate the memory of Hazrat Khalifatul Masih II, on his demise. Bilal Nuttle was one of the speakers. When his name was called, he stood at the rostrum for a few minutes without uttering a word and then broke down. Tears of sorrow were flowing on his face and his voice was choked with emotions. He then left the rostrum and sat down still crying bitterly. Later he apologised and said that he was unable to control his emotions as he loved the Second Khalifa.
                        I was much closed to Bilal and we used to spend hours together. He was most cheerful, generous and righteous and always smiling.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>He had a sister who lived in the countryside. Bilai once went to spend a few days with her. There he had a fatal heart attack and left this world to take his place in the Heaven.
                    </p>

                    <div class="quote"> "If nothing else let us convey Allah's message to this person."</div>

                    <p> Aziz Deen would write a few words on the blank spaces of the newspaper and the deaf and dumb person would reply in writing. This continued for a while until suddenly he saw a woman walking towards us. He asked me to keep the deaf and dumb man engaged and promised to bring the lady along. In spite of his endeavours, the lady paid no attention to him. Disappointed, he resumed his seat on the bench. The deaf and dumb person appeared to be very intelligent and had a sense of humour. After a while, he wrote on the paper:</p>

                    <div class="quote"> "You couldn't catch her?"</div>

                    <p> A little later, he wrote:</p>

                    <div class="quote"> "I would like to donate Â£ 5.00 to the admirable work that you are doing." Aziz Deen said to me: "Thank God, the rent for the Hall has been recovered in full."</div>

                    <p>Once he took me to the Old Bailey where he worked as an interpreter. On that day a Judge, well known for his short temper, was presiding. During the interval, as the Judge was proceeding to his retiring room, suddenly, Aziz Deen rushed towards him. After greeting him, he said:</p>

                    <div class="quote"> "If you don't mind may I present to you a book?"</div>

                    <p> At this apparent audacity on the part of him, the Judge's staffs were flabbergasted and this reaction was evident from their faces. However, the Judge accepted the book 'The Philosophy of the Teachings of Islam'. Aziz Deen had written his name and address on the inside of the book. After the Judge had entered his retiring room his staff threatened Aziz Deen and told him that in the Court premises, neither a book nor any other article could be given to a Judge and it was quite possible that the Judge would take some action against him. However, Aziz Deen took no notice of the intimidation. A few days later he happily came to the Mission House and showed me a letter that he had received from the Judge in which he had thanked him for the present. Not only had he highly praised the contents of the book but he also invited him to his country home for tea. Habitually Aziz Sahib kept a few small booklets and pamphlets in his pockets and whenever an opportunity arose, he would present some. </p>
                    <br />

                    <p>He told me that once his son Munir Deen said to him:</p>

                    <div class="quote"> "You have lived in England for quite a while and you have had the most excellent opportunities and yet you have spent all your life more or less like as a recluse and have never made any attempt to save."</div>

                    <p> He told me that he replied to his son in these terms:</p>

                    <div class="quote"> "In the shape of earnest supplications I have amassed a treasure for you from which you will benefit throughout your lives. God willing, you will never see a day when you are hard-up."</div>

                    <p>Once the subject of Life Insurance was under discussion. Aziz Sahib told me that he had never had the slightest desire to insure his life as he was fully confident that Allah would never allow his children to go to waste and that beyond the imagination of any Insurance Company He would bless them abundantly.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>He was deeply in love with the Mosque and that attribute was characteristic to him. His obedience and love for the Imam of a Mosque was also an outstanding quality. He would often say: "It's my experience that those who do not regularly bring their children to the Mosque and do not admonish them to strengthen their ties with the Mosque, either gradually sever their connection with it altogether or sometimes their contact with the Mosque becomes very fragile.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>Once we made an assessment and discovered with surprise that the children of nearly 70 % of those parents, who are not regular in their visits to the Mosque, gradually distance themselves from it. In the summer or in the winter, whether the weather was pleasant, overcast or snowbound, Aziz Deen never allowed his contact with the Mosque to be weakened. He maintained a positive and a loving relationship with the Imams of the Mosque. He often said that he who obeyed the Missionary became recipient of unbounded blessings. A particular attribute of his was the extreme love and devotion towards the members of the family of the Promised Messiah. His respect and devotion towards each member of the family was his specific quality. Whenever they were in London most members of the family stayed with him. Aziz Deen regarded hospitality and being of service to them a matter of pride. In 1961 when the beloved daughter of the Promised Messiah, Hadhrat Nawab Amat ul Hafeez Begum Sahiba came to England, he pleaded with her to stay with him and permit him to discharge the responsibility of a host. A daughter of Begum Sahiba was also with her and both stayed with Aziz Deen for nearly three months. With great pride, he would mention that when a daughter of the Promise Messiah (pbuh) visited London she blessed his house. Aziz Deen had the rare privilege of serving Quaid e Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah at the Mosque on several occasions. At all functions, he discharged responsibilities normally assigned to a host.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>Disgusted with the attitude of the Indian Muslims and in the absence of any practical measures the Quaid e Azam moved to London. He bought a house in Hampstead and started practice in the Privy Council. He announced that he would have no interest in or involvement in Indian politics. Hadhrat Khalifa tul Masih II who kept a watchful eye on the political developments in India directed the Imam of the London Mosque, Maulana Abd ur Raheem Dard, to persuade the Quaid e Azam, who in those days was merely referred to as 'Mr Jinnah', to return to India and once again assume leadership of the Muslims. Huzoor said that he could not see anyone amongst the Muslims who had the necessary ability to lead. Maulana Dard was directed to advise Mr Jinnah that if he agreed to return to India he would have the full support of the Jamaat Ahmadiyya.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>On receipt of these instructions, Maulana Dard got in touch with Mr Jinnah and invited him to the Mosque for tea. He told him that he had a message from the Imam of the Jamaat Ahmadiyya to convey to him. The Quaid accepted the invitation. On the morning of the Quaid's visit Maulana Dard instructed Mr Deen to make the necessary arrangements for tea. Mr Jinnah came at the appointed time. Both Maulana Dard and Mr. Jinnah sat in the drawing room of the house at 63 Melrose Road.Mr. Deen went to fetch tea and after placing it on the table he was about to leave when Maulana Dard invited him to join them.Maulana Dard conveyed the message from the second successor to the Promised Messiah, to him. He began his efforts to persuade him to return to India but the Quaid remained adamant and insisted that he would not return. Four or five similar sittings ensued. On each occasion Maulana Dard invited Mr.Deen to join in the discussion.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Aziz Deen was indeed a walking history of the London Mission. He had established cordial relationships with Colonel Douglas who delivered the judgement in the murder case against the Promised Messiah. The Colonel related the whole story to him and said: "When the Mirza came to my Court and I looked at him I became convinced that, without a shadow of a doubt, he was totally innocent. On the other hand, there was strong evidence against him. Christians, Muslims and Hindus all were determined to prove that the Mirza was guilty. The case dragged on for a few days and my confusion continued to intensify. Finally, on the day the judgement was to be delivered I was pacing up and down on the veranda of my house. I began to ponder over the proceedings. Suddenly in a vision, I saw the Mirza standing in front of me and he said:</p>
                    <div class="quote"> "I am innocent."</div>

                    <p> When I looked at his clean and pure face something within me directed me to have a good look and see if such a face could be that of a person guilty of murder. Something within me declared that he was certainly not a murderer. I went indoors and called the Superintendent of Police. I told him that this person could not possibly be guilty. The Superintendent said that the pivotal point of the case was the evidence of Abdul Hameed. The whole case was dependent on Abdul Hammer's statement that the Mirza had sent him to kill Dr. Clarke. However, as Abdul Hameed lives amongst the Christian Clergy, if he was separated from them and kept in the police custody he may tell the truth. The next day Douglas ordered that Abdul Hameed should be taken into police custody. Thereafter Abdul Hameed broke down and cried out that the Mirza had not spoken a single word to him and that the case was registered on the basis of what Reverend Martin Clarke had instructed him.
                        Aziz Deen relates that once, Colonel Douglas had said to him:</p>

                    <div class="quote"> "I am surprised that in such a short space of time the Mirza's Movement has made such rapid progress."</div>
                    <p>One can narrate a lot about Aziz Deen. I request friends to pray that the Almighty may raise the status of my dear brother in Heaven. May He shower His blessings upon his wife, his children, and his grandchildren.</p>
