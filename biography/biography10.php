                <<p>When I reached London in the early part of 1959 Dr. Abdus Salam lived in Putney, about a mile and a half from the Fazl Mosque. He was already a Professor of Theoretical Physics at the Imperial College. I had repeated opportunities to meet him. He visited the Mosque very often. Although he occupied a very high position and I was a mere young Missionary he always showed great kindness to me. He would often invite Hadhrat Chaudhry Zafrulla Khan Sahib </p>

                <p>From my school days, I have been interested in poetry and literature. Good verses always touched me deeply. Even in my childhood in my village when I heard Pushto poems I was elated. My interest further enhanced when I was at school. In the beginning, I was interested in novels and some concocted stories.
