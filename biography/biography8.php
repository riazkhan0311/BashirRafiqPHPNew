                <p>In February 1953, while I was a student in my last year at college agitation against the Ahmadiyya Jamaat erupted all over the Punjab, particularly in Lahore. Primarily the 'Ahraari' Jamaat were responsible for the turmoil. They seemed to have complete support of the Government of the Punjab. A secret pact seemed to have been concluded with Mian Mumtaz Muhammad Khan Daulatana, the then, Chief Minister in the Punjab. Apparently, it had been agreed that </p>

                <p>With His grace, the monthly periodical 'The Muslim Herald' started by me was being sent to several countries of the world. It had become a means of propagation of Ahmadiyyat and Islam. In certain countries, some libraries even subscribed to the periodical. I received very many letters from the readers every day. I received a letter from Imam Zook who was an Imam of a Mosque and a leader of the Muslims in Warsaw (Poland). He said that he had seen a copy of 'The Muslim Herald' </p>

                <p>In 1945, for the first time in my life, when I was a student at the T.I. High School in Qadian I had the privilege of an audience with Hadhrat Mirza Nasir Ahmad. However, from the early part of 1949 when in my first year I joined the T.I. College in Lahore, a strong, loving and benevolent relationship began. Huzoor was then the Principal of the College and in those days, in a way the T.I. College was at its zenith. Due to Huzoor's excellent administration,</p>

                <p>Spain is probably the only country in the world that has witnessed 700 years of Islamic rule with splendor. The Islamic Quranic teachings and treasures profited not only the Muslim Spain but also the rest of the whole world during this golden age. The Muslims entered Spain when the Spanish were suffering from tyranny and despotism. At that time, the whole of Europe was in a pathetic state.</p>

                <p>My parents were blessed with five daughters and three sons. A brother and a sister passed away when they were five and six years old respectively. My brother was named Bashir Ahmad and my sister was named Mah e Talaat. Naturally, it was a great shock for my parents as two of their children had passed away within a period of forty days. Talaat was the first to go to meet her Maker and Bashir followed her forty days later.</p>
