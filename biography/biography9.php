                <p>On two different occasions, the Almighty God has enabled Saleema and me to visit the land of our beloved Prophet. He enabled us to present ourselves at his grave. Before writing about our journeys I would particularly wish to record my gratitude to my son in law Dr. Abdul Waheed Khan and my daughter Amatun Naseer (Neeno). It was through their initiative, help and prayers that I was enabled to perform Umra on two different occasions. They made all the necessary </p>

                <p>When I arrived in England in 1959, with overwhelming intensity, I felt that we should pay particular attention to the education and training of the young and the new converts. At that time English literature, covering the subject of tarbiyyat (training) was almost non-existent. So that they may offer their Salaat in the exact prescribed manner, for familiarizing the young and the new converts there was paramount need for a book covering 'Islamic Salaat'. Covering this particular </p>

                <p>There was only a primary school in our village. As the middle school was at a distance of three miles from our village my father decided that for my schooling I should proceed to Peshawar where my uncle (mother's brother) Abdus Salaam Khan lived and where many other relations resided and served. I was fortunate in that around that time, to stay with his elder son, Abdus Salaam Khan, my maternal grandfather Hadhrat Muhammad Ilyas Khan got back to Peshawar from Mastung </p>

He said that he would be happy if I could accompany him at my own expense. A short while earlier I had already written to the Sahibzada that under instructions from Mr Tubman, the President of Liberia, and the Liberian Government had already sent me some travel vouchers. I said that by using these vouchers and without spending any money of my own, I could undertake a journey to those few countries. I believe the Sahibzada had in mind </p>
