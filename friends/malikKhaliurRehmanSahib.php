                    <p>Malik Sahib was generally known as K.R. Mullik. He arrived in this country in 1958. On my arrival in 1959 he was Quaid Khuddamul Ahmadiyya London. With dedicated team of workers he worked hard to establish Khuddamul Ahmadiyya on firm grounds. Malik Sahib was a pious and dedicated person. He was very active in the preaching of the Faith. His circle of friends was vast.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>On the arrival of Hazrat Khalifatul Masih IV, Malik Sahib became his interpreter. He would render his Friday sermons and Question Answer session into English. He never missed Friday service at the Mosque.
